            <p>In ES5, to find an element in an array, you use the indexOf() or lastIndexOf() methods. However, these methods are quite limited because they return the index of the first matching element only.

                ES6 introduced a new method called find() added to the Array.prototype object.

                The find() method returns the first element in an array that satisfies a provided function.

                The following shows the syntax of the find() method:</p>
        </div>
    );
