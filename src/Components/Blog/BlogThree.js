            <p>JavaScript is a prototype-based, Object Oriented programming language. After the ES6 updates, JavaScript allowed for “prototypal inheritance”, meaning that objects and methods can be shared, extended, and copied.

                Sharing amid objects makes for easy inheritance of structure (data fields), behavior (functions / methods), and state (data values).

                JavaScript is the most common of the prototype-capable languages, and its capabilities are relatively unique. When used appropriately, prototypical inheritance in JavaScript is a powerful tool that can save hours of coding.

                Today, we want to get you acquainted with prototypal inheritance in JavaScript to get you up to date with the ES6 capabilities.</p>
